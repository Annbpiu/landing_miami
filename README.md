- SCSS: Enhanced styling with modular, reusable code.
- JavaScript: Enabled interactivity for a dynamic user experience.
- Gulp: Automated workflowsâ€”compiling SCSS, optimizing images, and ensuring code quality with Stylelint.
- Focused on performance optimization, mobile responsiveness, and clean code practices, creating an engaging, user-friendly interface tailored to contemporary design standards.
